This Code is to convert photo files into .txt files
The main idea (it is not a novel idea for sure,but an independent approach) came when i created some python based codes* using work workstation, then I have discovered after finishing that the workstation is locked and not internet connected anymore !!!!!! ,such that I canâ€™t export the files.
        *created codes where concerned with two projects. Scraping data from all famous news websites on daily basis, then performing some data analysis, just to know what was going on worldwide. Famous news websites are   not just reporting news, they create public opinion that consequently defines decisions taken.(I Have created this project during Covid pandemic, extending to Russian-Ukrainian conflict, where there was a great difference in public opinion creation process).However, the other project was an automated YouTube likes growing program. However, YouTube can detect this automation, and after likes incremental, it is reduced back in next day.
 I wanted a code that reads image files and outputs .txt files. An open-cv image detection simple project.
